# flutter_weather_app

### This application shows the weather in the current location and the weather in the selected location, and also shows the forecast for the next eight days.

#
### In this program I used the following packages:
####  - state manager: *BLoC*;
####  - HTTP requests: *http*;
####  - geolocation data : *geolocator*;
####  - text animation on the welcome page : *animated_text_kit*;
####  - to determine the day of the week : *intl*;
####  - to simplify code writing : *equatable*;
